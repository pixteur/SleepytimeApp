/// Splitting a chapter into synthesis chunks that respect narration direction.
///
/// Two forces pull opposite ways. The reader deliberately uses **a few sizeable
/// chunks** so each one's playback outlasts the next one's synthesis, which is
/// what hides a cloud voice's fixed per-request latency. But a narration cue
/// applies to a paragraph, and a cue can only be honoured if it maps onto a
/// whole request — you cannot change the voice halfway through one.
///
/// The hybrid rule: **a chunk boundary is forced only where the direction
/// actually changes.** Consecutive paragraphs sharing a cue are merged and then
/// handed to the ordinary size-based chunker, so a chapter narrated in one
/// voice throughout costs exactly what it costs today. Only a chapter that
/// genuinely shifts tone pays for the extra requests, and only at the points
/// where it shifts.
